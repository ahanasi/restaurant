# restaurant
This project was created as part of the Odin Project [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page). 

A simple restaurant homepage based on [Rasa](https://www.rasaindian.com/). This site was created to familiarize myself with Webpack and ES6 Modules. The DOM elements of the website were created using Javascript alone, while SASS was used for styling.
